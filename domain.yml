  utter_gluten_info:
  - text: "Gluten is a mixture of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It can increase systemic inflammation when ingested. 
    Gluten seems to particularly negatively affect the functioning of the cerebellum." 

  utter_sugar_info:
  - text: "People with ASD, like those with type 2 diabetes, have impaired glucose tolerance and excessive levels of insulin. Avoiding sugar and refined carbohydrates and increasing lean protein can dramatically improve concentration and judgment, and decrease impulsiveness."  

  utter_corn_info:
  - text: "Corn has the most unhealthy fatty-acid profile of any grain. There is simply nothing truly beneficial and many potentially harmful things that can come from eating corn."  

  utter_dairy_info:
  - text: "When casein (one of the proteins in dairy) mixes with stomach acid, it produces something called an exorphin. This may lead to inflammation of the gut, inability to concentrate, brain fog just to mention but a few. This may worsen the condition."
