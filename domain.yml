  utter_gluten_info:
  - text: "Gluten is a mixture of proteins found in grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. It can increase systemic inflammation when ingested. 
    Gluten seems to particularly negatively affect the functioning of the cerebellum." 

  utter_sugar_info:
  - text: "People with ASD, like those with type 2 diabetes, have impaired glucose tolerance and excessive levels of insulin. Avoiding sugar and refined carbohydrates and increasing lean protein can dramatically improve concentration and judgment, and decrease impulsiveness."  

  utter_corn_info:
  - text: "Corn has the most unhealthy fatty-acid profile of any grain. There is simply nothing truly beneficial and many potentially harmful things that can come from eating corn."  

  utter_dairy_info:
  - text: "When casein (one of the proteins in dairy) mixes with stomach acid, it produces something called an exorphin. This may lead to inflammation of the gut, inability to concentrate, brain fog just to mention but a few. This may worsen the condition."  

  utter_artificial_ingredients_info:
  - text: "Research points to a possible link between autism symptoms and artificial ingredients in our food supply. Avoid all additives, preservatives, dyes and artificial colors, artificial flavorings, and artificial sweeteners. "  

  utter_dietary_info:
  - text: "There is no specific ASD diet, but removing certain proteins may relieve symptoms. The gluten-free, casein-free (GFCF) diet has the most research and is one of the most common dietary interventions." 

  utter_vitamins_info:
  - text: "Vitamin and mineral supplements included for general deficiency in some autism treatment plans include vitamins A, B6, C, and D, as well as folate and magnesium."
